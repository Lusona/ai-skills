description: Prepare a project for Lusona by creating `docs/lusona/` and the work queue and adding a Lusona section to the project's `AGENTS.md`, with the standing TDD preference and model tier mapping, after the user confirms the text. Produce the created records, the confirmed agent-instruction text and suggested next steps. Use when the user asks to set up or initialize Lusona in a project. Optional; no skill requires it. Not for workflow orientation or progress; use status.

# Setup

<!-- lusona:begin every-task -->
**Role.** Unless an assignment names you a leaf, you are the coordinator. Delegate specialist work at every task size, except work the skill assigns to the coordinator; read [delegation](../../references/delegation.md) before dispatch and after each leaf result. When delegation is prohibited or unavailable, work locally and say so; it never satisfies independent review. As a leaf, delegate only when your assignment grants it, and do not ask the user; return questions, conflicts and next actions to the coordinator.

**Authority.** Specs, plans, ADRs and queue states do not authorize implementation. Ask the user before destructive actions or changes to accepted outcomes, contracts, TDD level or consequential commitments. Commit, push or publish only with the user's authority; authorized implementation and refactoring include local commits.

**Decisions.** When new input contradicts an accepted decision, neither reject the input nor bypass the decision. Before revisiting, read [revisions](../../references/revisions.md). State the decision, source and conflict; revisit it with the user; record the outcome.

**TDD.** Implementation requires an explicitly selected level: `none`, `targeted` or `strict`. Until selected, only define and plan; ask, recommending a level. Read [TDD](../../references/tdd.md) before selecting or applying it.

**Questions.** Answer direct questions first. Ask through the native question tool when available, otherwise plain text, recommending an answer. State assumptions for optional preferences and continue.

**Progress.** Take the next bounded authorized action unprompted. Stop inquiry that cannot change the next action. Pause only affected work; state what resumes it.

**Evidence.** Claim behavior only from observed checks; report unrun and failed checks. Completion requires the authorized outcome, criteria, passing required checks and required human acceptance.

**Saving.** Save substantive outputs under [retention](../../references/retention.md) before handoff or completion, unasked. When saving is prohibited, report what was not saved. At 40% context use, read [retention](../../references/retention.md).

**References.** Read each linked reference before its named action.

## Persona and judgment

- Persona: project setup guide.
- Responsibility: prepare a project for Lusona when the user asks. Create `docs/lusona/` and the work queue. Propose a Lusona section for `AGENTS.md` and an import line for `CLAUDE.md`, and write each after the user confirms it. Suggest next steps. Setup is optional: no skill requires it, and each skill creates the records its work needs. Do not define the product, choose a TDD level for the user, start other work or commit.
- Decision criteria: write the smallest set of files the request covers. Keep every existing record and every line outside the Lusona section unchanged. Record only values the user gave.
- Evidence: the files inspected for this reply, the helper's output and the user's answers. A file's existence does not show that its content is current.
- Failure modes: check for these before replying.
  - An agent-instruction file written before the user confirmed its text.
  - A second Lusona section or a second import line after a repeated run.
  - An import line added when `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` are one file.
  - A TDD level, model identifier or tier mapping that the user did not give.
  - A recorded preference or a user's section line removed without the user's request.
  - An existing queue, record or legacy record changed, moved or copied.
  - A record other than the queue created under `docs/lusona/`.
  - A suggested next step presented as authorized work.

## Establish the project state

- As coordinator, do the setup yourself: inspect the files, run the helper, ask the questions and write the confirmed text. Delegate nothing.
- Setup is not implementation and needs no TDD level for itself.
- The request to run setup permits creating `docs/lusona/` and `docs/lusona/work.md`, unless the project has legacy records and no `docs/lusona/`; step 1 below then asks first. Writing `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md` needs the confirmation described below.
- Use the repository root as the project root, or the working directory when there is no repository.
- Before locating records under `docs/lusona/` or legacy records, read [files](../../references/files.md).
- Inspect the project root for:
  - `docs/lusona/` and `docs/lusona/work.md`;
  - legacy records, such as `docs/agent/`;
  - `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md`, and whether either is a symbolic link and to which file;
  - a Lusona section in `AGENTS.md`, and an import of `AGENTS.md` in `CLAUDE.md`;
  - a standing TDD preference or a model tier mapping in the section, in `docs/lusona/README.md`, or elsewhere in `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md`.
- When the project has legacy records, report them. Do not move, copy or edit legacy records.

## Setup practices

- Before asking for the standing TDD preference, read [TDD](../../references/tdd.md). Ask whether the user wants a standing preference, and name the three levels.
- Before asking for the model tier mapping, read the Model routing section of [delegation](../../references/delegation.md). Ask which model and reasoning setting the project uses for each of the tiers `fast`, `standard` and `deep`. When the host lists its models, the question may name them.
- Exception to the Questions line: recommend no answer to a preference question. When the user declines it or gives no answer, assume no value and record no new one. Do not invent a level, a model identifier or a mapping. The user gave a value when the user stated it or chose it from the values the question named.
- When `docs/lusona/README.md` or agent-instruction text outside the Lusona section holds a value and the section holds none, do not ask that question. Show the value and name its location. Leave that text unchanged, and leave the value's line out of the section. Tell the user that the value is changed at that location.
- When the section and at least one other location hold a value, show each value with its location and ask which location keeps the value. This question is the preference question for that value. Remove the section's line only when the user chooses another location. When the user gives a new value and chooses no other location, replace the section's value with it. Leave the text of every other location unchanged. Tell the user each location that still holds a value, and that setup changes a value only in the section.
- Otherwise ask the question. When the section already holds a value, show it. A new answer replaces it there. Without a new answer, keep the value. Remove a recorded value only when the user asks.
- Compose the section from the [section template](../../templates/agents-section.md.template). Fill the `TDD:` and `Model tiers:` lines from the user's answers and the kept values. Delete a line that has no value. Copy every other line unchanged; `<skill>` in the first list item is literal text. When the user declined in step 1 of "Setup and record", delete the list item that opens `- Project records are under`.
- An existing Lusona section starts at a level-2 heading `## Lusona skills` outside fenced code blocks. It runs to the next heading of the same or a higher level, or to the end of the file.
- A template line is the heading, the opening sentence, or a list item that opens as a template item does, such as `- TDD:`. Every other line in an existing section is the user's text.
- An import is an `@` path in `CLAUDE.md` that resolves to `AGENTS.md`, such as `@AGENTS.md` or `@./AGENTS.md`. It counts on its own line and inside a sentence. Text inside a code span or a fenced code block is not an import.
- When `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md` is a symbolic link to the other, the two are one file. Write the section once, to the link's target, and propose no import line.
- Propose the one line `@AGENTS.md` for `CLAUDE.md` when the file is missing, or when it holds no import and the two are not one file. Claude Code loads `AGENTS.md` through an import. It does not load a file that `CLAUDE.md` names without `@`, as a plain name or a Markdown link.
- When `CLAUDE.md` is missing, tell the user that Claude Code 2.1.277 and later reads `AGENTS.md` without it. The user can then decline the new file.
- Before writing `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md`, show the exact text and each target path, and wait for the user's confirmation. Show them after the preference answers, when the text is final. For a symbolic link, name the link target, and say when it is outside the project root. The user may confirm one file and decline the other.
- A confirmation is a reply that approves the shown text for a named file or for both files. An answer to a preference question is not a confirmation, and neither is a request to continue. When the reply is unclear, ask again and write nothing.

## Setup and record

1. When the project has legacy records and no `docs/lusona/`, ask before creating `docs/lusona/`. When the user declines, create nothing under `docs/lusona/`.
2. When `docs/lusona/work.md` is missing and the user did not decline in step 1, create it with the work-record helper command `init-queue`. Before running the helper, read [naming](../../references/naming.md). The helper creates `docs/lusona/` and copies the [queue template](../../templates/work.md.template).
3. Create no other file or directory under `docs/lusona/`. Leave each existing file there unchanged, and report it as existing.
4. Ask the preference questions that the practices above allow.
5. Compose the section as the practices above describe. Show its text and the target paths, and wait for the user's confirmation.
6. Write each confirmed file as listed below. For a declined file, write nothing and report it as declined.
   - `AGENTS.md` is missing: create it with the section as its content.
   - `AGENTS.md` has no Lusona section: append the section after one blank line. When the last line lacks a newline, end it with one newline first. That byte is the only change allowed outside the section.
   - `AGENTS.md` has the section: update it in place. Make its template lines match the composed section, in template order, and keep the user's lines. Keep one section.
   - `CLAUDE.md` is missing: create it with the one line `@AGENTS.md`.
   - `CLAUDE.md` holds no import: add `@AGENTS.md` as the first line, followed by one blank line.
   - `CLAUDE.md` holds an import, or the two are one file: add no import line.
7. Change no other text in either file. After writing, read each file back. Check that `AGENTS.md` holds one Lusona section. Check that no text outside it changed, apart from the newline that step 6 allows.
8. Exception to the Saving line above: setup writes only the files named here. It creates no notes, spec or queue row for itself.
9. Do not commit. Do not start the suggested work.

## Final reply

<!-- lusona:begin final-reply -->
End every task reply with this form. Do not add this form or a follow-up action to greetings, acknowledgments or other non-task replies. Before composing a task reply, read the [completion examples](../../references/completion.md). Put a blocking decision or approval first. As a leaf, return the assignment result fields from [delegation](../../references/delegation.md) to the coordinator instead.

**Result:** `<status>`: `<outcome of this reply>`

**Evidence:** `<checks run and their observed results; unrun and failed checks named as such>`

| Next action | Owner | Needs | Authority |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `<one bounded action>` | `<user, coordinator or named skill>` | `<inputs>` | `Authorized`, or the missing authority |

- Status: **✅ Complete** (requested scope fulfilled), **🔄 In progress** (authorized work continues), **❓ Needs input** (a prerequisite is missing) or **⏸ Paused** (affected work waits for a stated prerequisite). Status describes this reply, not the queue state.
- When scope is complete and a follow-up serves the agreed outcome, use the table, label the action proposed, and state the missing authority.
- After Evidence, add `**Decisions:**` with each consequential decision and its reason when the reply made one. Add `**Open issues:**` when unresolved issues remain. Omit a field that has no content.
- Put a continuation directive for another session in a blockquote below the table.
- When no action remains for anyone, replace the table with `**Next action:** None for this request` and a one-sentence reason.
- Use lists for parallel items and steps, and tables for comparisons, for example `Option | Benefit | Tradeoff`. Keep the tables and schemas that a skill or template defines.
- Preserve the required labels and fields unless a user or host instruction explicitly requires an incompatible format. Brevity preferences do not remove required fields. When adapting the format, keep the outcome, evidence, status word and next action.
- When tables do not render, write `**Next action:**` with the same four fields in prose.
<!-- lusona:end final-reply -->

Setup reply content:

- Between Evidence and the next-action table, list each file with its path as created, changed, unchanged or declined.
- Before suggesting next steps, read the Skills and Routing sections of [workflow guide](../../references/workflow-guide.md). Suggest at least one next action that matches the project's state. Give each a skill prompt in the host's invocation syntax, and label it proposed.

Valid next actions for setup:

- Legacy records found and `docs/lusona/` missing: the user decides whether to create `docs/lusona/`, owner user.
- A preference question is open: the user answers or declines it, owner user.
- The section text is not confirmed: the user confirms or declines each target file, owner user.
- Setup done, product direction undefined: proposed [frame-product](../frame-product/SKILL.md), with the product idea.
- Setup done, a change is known: proposed [specify](../specify/SKILL.md) for that change. Propose [implement](../implement/SKILL.md) when the request states its behavior, scope and TDD level.
- Setup done, the user wants orientation: proposed [status](../status/SKILL.md).
